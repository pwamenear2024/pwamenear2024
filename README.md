- 👋 Hi, I’m Paul
- 👀 I’m interested in sustainability tech, entrepreneurship, and helping businesses leverage technology to do more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to not be a corporate bot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that makes life more pleasant, and communities more resilient.
- 📫 How to reach me : menear.ca
- 😄 Pronouns: are a part of the English language (and others). I dislike that we argue over them, let people be themselves without judgement ffs.
- ⚡ Fun fact: fun is irrelevant. It's a natural part of every fibre in the tapestry of life.
